Generation after generation, members of the Spencer family stepped up to the plate to provide resolutions to all problems. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina snatched up the Spencers and disbursed them across the United States.In 2022, the youngest son of Dorothy Spencer decided it was time to bring the family together and offer our services to others.Problem solving Resolution Company.
