  Spencer Trucking was founded in July of 2010 by President and CEO, Larry Spencer Sr. Larry started this company<br>
  with the vision of creating employment opportunities for many people like himself who suddenly found themselves<br>
  without work. Spencer Trucking was started with one truck and trailer and a vision of becoming a leader in the <br>
  auto hauling industry. Spencer Trucking has grown over the years, added Spencer Logistics, and now hauls for <br>
  several of the major automotive manufacturers along with servicing many companies in the United States and <br>
  Canada. We service all 48 of the continental United States and parts of Canada.

<h3>
  Our Safety Program
</h3>
<p>
  Safety is our number one concern at Spencer Trucking. We are dedicated to keeping our drivers, customerâ€™s product,<br>
  and the general public safe while on the roads. Spencer Trucking has implemented a safety program to ensure that all <br>
  safety measures are followed. Our Safety personell provides training for our current drivers, completes extensive <br>
  background checks on potential drivers and sub-haulers, as well as attending many seminars to keep up with the latest <br>
  safety regulations.</p>

<p>Our safety department at Spencer Trucking focuses on hiring the best drivers available. This is accomplished by performing<br>
  extensive background research using as many resources as possible, such as the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration<br>
  (CSA), Motor Vehicle Reports from insurance companies, and scores that are listed on Central Dispatch, just to name a few.<br>
  Researching the background of potential drivers extensively ensures that we hire drivers who are skilled in safety regulations.</p>

<p>
Spencer Trucking is committed to keeping our drivers up to date on the continually changing safety regulations. Because the D.O.T.<br>
  safety rules and regulations are changing continuously, we have put in place a safety department which is responsible for tracking<br>
  these changes and implementing training opportunities for our drivers. We ensure our drivers stay up to date on these changes through<br>
  regular training programs, safety meetings, and safety checks.</p>

<b><u>Spencer Trucking has a zero tolerance policy for drivers who do not follow the safety policies and procedures.</u></b>
