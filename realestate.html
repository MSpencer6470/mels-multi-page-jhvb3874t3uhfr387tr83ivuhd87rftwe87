  <u>About Laina Spencer</u>
</h2>
<p>
  Hey, I’m Laina Spencer. I specialize in assisting people that are looking to have a REALTOR that can
navigate them through the home selling and buying process. I've been a Real Estate agent in Baton
Rouge, LA for 6 years and I’ve served over 150+ families to date. The best praise I’ve ever received
from a client was “ that I handled their transaction as if it were my own family buying a home”.
Helping people to successfully obtain their dreams in one of the biggest transactions of their lives,
makes me so proud and motivates everything I do. If you’re looking for a real estate agent that you
can trust and has your best interest at heart, I’d love to work with you! If there is anything I can do
to help you, please give me a call.
